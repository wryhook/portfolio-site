# Portfolio Site

This is a portfolio site I built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

If you'd like to make a similar site for yourself:
- [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) this repository and run `npm install` in your terminal to install the dependencies
- To view the site in your browser, use the `npm run dev` command and visit `http://localhost:3000`
- If you're new to Next.js, you can follow [this tutorial](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) to get started
- If you've never used Tailwind, you can [read the docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) or [watch these screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5f_mz_zU5eXWYDXHUDOLBE0scnuJofO0) to familiarise yourself
